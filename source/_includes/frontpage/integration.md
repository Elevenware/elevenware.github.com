Integration
-----------

I spent several years building robust messaging systems for a certain [optometric](http://specsavers.com) retailer. From
getting in-store POS systems talking to head office apps, to making sure various legacy databases talked to yet more 
head office apps, I took care of quite a bit of integration. Using [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org), ([Apache Servicemix](http://servicemix.apache.org) and [Camel](http://camel.apache.org), we achieved a lot.

I can help you with integration and messaging, too.
