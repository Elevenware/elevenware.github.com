Web Development
---------------

My bread and butter these days is web development. I've been building [Grails](http://grails.org) apps for
several years now, both for client apps such as

* [Sky Living](http://skyliving.sky.com)
* [Sky Atlantic](http://skyatlantic.sky.com)
* [Sky Movies](http://skymovies.sky.com)
* [Odobo Limited](http://www.odobo.com)

As well as several of my own apps

* [Read-only Twitter](http://readonlytwitter.com)
* [You.gl](http://you.gl)

But I'm happy to use anything, really. I've used a number of common Java web frameworks, including Struts2, Spring Web-MVC and GWT. I also play around with [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), and other Ruby frameworks, such as [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) that this very site is built with. I've even played with Node.JS and the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework.

These days, I'm more inclined to use front-end templating, with something such as [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org), which has the added advantage that your back-end is there largely to provide web services that are consumed by Angular controllers. The upshot of this is, ramping up to using a new web framework is a lot quicker. With an ORM, a templating language, routing and a way of gluing it all together, web frameworks are similar enough that if you've used a few, you can turn your hand to any of them fairly quickly.
