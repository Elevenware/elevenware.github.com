Elevenware Limited is a one-man software consultancy based on the south coast of the UK. I do web development
in [Grails](http://grails.org), front-end and back-end, and also dabble in [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.org). As well
as web development, I am experienced in 'regular' Java and enterprise Java development, in particular integration
and messaging using [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org) and [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org). 
I am not afraid of HTML, CSS, Javascript or bash scripting.
